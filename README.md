# BlockWindowsUpdate
Uploaded old project for appeal purpose

constantly monitor windows update service, once it's started we terminate it and disable its services.
Windows update is annoy, and after version 1803, there's no way to turn it off without messing with group policy and registry keys, it also ruined my first cs61b project by forcing me restarting my computer to update and failing corrupting the entire OS. so time to get rid off it, why fix what's not broken?(ffuuuuuuuuuuu windows update)
